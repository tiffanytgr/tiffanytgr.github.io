## Work Experience
**Assistant Manager, Data Scientist @ SATS Ltd (_Jan 2024 - Present_)**
- Led a project for Cargo team to use Computer Vision to locate shipments within the Airfreight Terminal. Use YOLO for Object Detection of shipments and OCR to for identification. Reduced missing shipments from 200 to less than 100 monthly, cost avoidance due to reduction in penalties by s$80K yearly. Reduction in manhours spent searching for shipments by 30%, and reduction in dwell time of shipments by 15%. Developed it from a MVP to a production-level solution.
- Co-led a Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis initiative to enhance service quality for Singapore Airlines customers, analyzing diverse data sources, including surveys, complaint logs, and social media, using NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
- Partnering with Microsoft as a Copilot Advocate, integrating AI-driven solutions into operations and fostering AI adoption within the organization.
- Conducting research into cutting-edge AI solutions tailored for the logistics sector, including applications in predictive analytics, route optimization, and supply chain resilience to enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs.

**APAC Data Scientist, Supply Chain Excellence @ Johnson & Johnson (_Dec 2021 - Dec 2023_)**
- Automated reporting pipelines using Alteryx, Python, and PowerQuery, improving reporting accuracy to 95% and saving 3 hours per week.
- Designed and implemented PowerBI dashboards to enhance portfolio visibility, resulting in cost-savings of ~500K USD by enabling leadership to prioritize high-impact projects.
- Developed and deployed demand forecasting models (ARIMA, Random Forest) with a 10% accuracy improvement,optimizing supply chain performance by reduction in inventory levels of 10%. 
- Built a POC Python-based web scraping tool to track shipment locations, increasing real-time supply chain transparency.

**Senior Data Analyst, Regional Operations @ Ninja Van (_July 2019 - Nov 2021_)**
- Collaborated with regional COOs to streamline operational workflows, improving cross-functional alignment and enhancing operational effectiveness.
- Created and optimized SQL queries for logistics operations, enhancing query efficiency by 25% and supporting data-driven decision-making.
- Automated weekly reports with Python, reducing reporting time by 15% and enabling teams to prioritize strategic projects.

## Projects
### Posture Analysis using Mediapipe
[Link to repo](https://github.com/tiffanytgr/posture-analysis-app)

This project aims to empower individuals to improve their running / walking postures by leveraging computer vision to develop a classification model app that identifies good or bad postures.
In the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle, many individuals turn to running or walking as a form of exercise. However, poor running or walking posture can lead to unnecessary stress and strain on muscles and joints, and hindered progress towards fitness goals. Poor posture can cause pain and injuries in up to 79% of adults. Poor posture may stem from various factors, such as fatigue, lack of awareness, or even ill-fitted running shoes. Understanding and correcting posture can be the key to preventing injuries and optimizing performance. 
Model was deployed via the Streamlit app, and can ingest a image / video to identify people with poor posture in real time.

### 3D Reconstruction of images using Structure from Motion (COLMAP)
[Link to repo](https://github.com/tiffanytgr/MSAI_6121_compvision/tree/main/Project)

Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is a widely used computer vision technique that reconstructs 3D structures from 2D images. By utilizing PyCOLMAP, a Python binding for
COLMAP, we streamlined the reconstruction process to handle camera calibration, feature matching, and 3D point cloud generation efficiently.

Example of reconstructing a Structure:
