## ðŸ’¼ Work Experience

**Data Scientist, AI Hub**  
_Louis Dreyfus Company (Jun 2025 â€“ Present)_  

**Assistant Manager, Data Scientist**  
_SATS Ltd (Jan 2024 â€“ Jun 2025)_  
- Led a project for Cargo team to use Computer Vision to locate shipments within the Airfreight Terminal. Use YOLO for Object Detection of shipments and OCR to for identification. Reduced missing shipments from 200 to less than 100 monthly, cost avoidance due to reduction in penalties by s$80K yearly. Reduction in manhours spent searching for shipments by 30%, and reduction in dwell time of shipments by 15%. Developed it from a MVP to a production-level solution.
- Designed and deployed an AI-powered agent in Azure to automatically extract cancelled and rescheduled flight data from unstructured TELEX-style messages, emails, and SQL databases. Integrated LLM-based reasoning to interpret inconsistent formats and identify relevant records, consolidating results into a structured dataset. Built a Teams chat interface for operational staff to query disruptions in real time, reducing manual data extraction.
