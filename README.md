## Work Experience
**Assistant Manager, Data Scientist @ SATS Ltd (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Led a project for Cargo team to use Computer Vision to locate shipments within the Airfreight Terminal. Use YOLO for Object Detection of shipments and OCR to for identification. Reduced missing shipments from 200 to less than 100 monthly, cost avoidance due to reduction in penalties by s$80K yearly. Reduction in manhours spent searching for shipments by 30%, and reduction in dwell time of shipments by 15%. Developed it from a MVP to a production-level solution.
- Co-led a Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis initiative to enhance service quality for Singapore Airlines customers, analyzing diverse data sources, including surveys, complaint logs, and social media, using NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
